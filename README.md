# iPhone Sentiment & Topic Modelling (Reddit)

This project analyzes Reddit discussions about **iPhones** using **sentiment analysis** and **topic modelling**. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we classify user sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and uncover hidden discussion themes around Apple‚Äôs flagship product.  

The project was completed as part of the *COSC2671 ‚Äì Social Media and Network Analytics* course at RMIT University.

- Perform sentiment analysis using:  
  - Opinion word counting.  
  - VADER Sentiment Analysis.  
- Apply **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for topic modelling.  
- Visualize trends in sentiment and identify dominant topics in user discussions.

The notebook will:

Collect Reddit posts & comments from r/iPhone.

Clean and preprocess the text corpus.

Apply Count-based and VADER sentiment analysis.

Perform topic modelling with LDA.

Generate visualizations (word frequency, sentiment timelines, intertopic distance map).
